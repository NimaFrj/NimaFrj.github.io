    "text": "Hi! I’m Mohammad Amin, a research assistant at University of Tehran. My research interest includes Machine Vision, Autoencoders, Optimization and Auxetic Structures. I’d rather be called “Nima” as I go by this among my friends! (to monitor forest carbon sequestration across New York State, track the development of early-successional forests, and more) and visualization (including using game engines as a GIS and making it easier to make reproducible VR environments for research). By training I’m either an ecologist (specializing in landscape and translational ecology) or environmental scientist; professionally, I’ve worked as a data analyst, software engineer, and chicken farmer.\nOn this site I keep a list of my publications, presentations, and my CV, as well as a technical blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering ground noise from LiDAR returns produces inferior models of forest aboveground biomass in heterogenous landscapes.
