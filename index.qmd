## Bio

Hi! I'm Mohammad Amin, a research assistant at University of Tehran. My research interest includes Machine Vision, Autoencoders, Optimization and Auxetic Structures. I'd rather be called "Nima" as I go by this among my friends!

On this site I keep a list of my publications, notable projects, [my CV](cv.pdf), and a simple [blog](blog.html).
