## Bio

Hi! I'm Mohammad Amin, a recent graduate of the University of Tehran with a master's degree in mechanical engineering. My research interests include Auxetic Mechanical Structures, Machine Vision, Autoencoders, and Optimization. I'd rather be called "Nima" as I go by this among my friends!

I'm passionate about using my knowledge to make a positive impact on society. In the future, I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science and work on projects involving machine learning since this greatly impacts human lives. I'd like to have my own contributions.

When not working on my research, I enjoy playing chess [on chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/darvack), reading [Tim Urban's blog](https://waitbutwhy.com/), or listening to [Lex Fridman podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman).

On this site, you'll find a list of my publications, notable projects, [my CV](https://nimafrj.github.io/cv.pdf), and a simple [blog](Blog) where I share my thoughts on computer science, life, and self-improvement.
